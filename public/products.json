The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle\u2014the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder. Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle\u2019s teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord\u2019s weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore\u2019s own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry\u2019s\u2014and Hogwarts\u2019s\u2014future in shadow.","details":null,"author_id":148,"language_id":1,"age_id":5,"price":325,"name":"Rowling, J.K.","top":0,"categories":[{"id":887,"category_id":1,"product_id":445,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":888,"category_id":2,"product_id":445,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":446,"title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","slug":"Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerer's-Stone","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=fo4rzdaHDAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=fo4rzdaHDAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780590353427","description":"Rescued from the outrageous neglect of his aunt and uncle, a young boy with a great destiny proves his worth while attending Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.","details":null,"author_id":149,"language_id":1,"age_id":5,"price":230,"name":"J.

He wants to get away from the malicious Dursleys and go to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to dream about his crush, Cho Chang (and maybe do more than dream). And now that he\u2019s gotten the hang of things at Hogwarts\u2014he hopes\u2014he just wants to be a normal fourteen-year-old wizard. But even by his standards, Harry's year is anything but normal. First Dumbledore announces the revival of a grand competition that hasn't taken place for one hundred years: the Triwizard Tournament, where a Hogwarts champion will compete against rivals from two other schools of magic in three highly dangerous tasks. Then someone frames Harry to participate in the tournament\u2014which really means someone wants him dead. Harry is guided through the competition by Professor Alastor Moody, this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, but he must also contend with a nasty reporter named Rita Skeeter, who digs up some highly unflattering secrets about Hagrid; a terrible fight with Ron, who is deeply jealous of Harry's fame; Hermione's newfound activism on behalf of house-elves; and the terrifying prospect of asking a date to the Yule Ball. Worst of all, Lord Voldemort may finally have gathered the materials necessary for his rejuvenation... and he has a faithful servant at Hogwarts waiting only for a sign. No, nothing is ever normal for Harry Potter. And in his case, different can be deadly.","details":null,"author_id":148,"language_id":1,"age_id":5,"price":265,"name":"Rowling, J.K.","top":0,"categories":[{"id":893,"category_id":1,"product_id":448,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":894,"category_id":2,"product_id":448,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":449,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)","slug":"Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-(Book-5)","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=HjI0BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=HjI0BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780439358071","description":"In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Lord Voldemort has returned to the Wizarding world, presenting a threat that neither the magical government nor the authorities at Hogwarts can stop. In response to his reappearance, Dumbledore reactivates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society which works to defeat the Dark Lord's minions and protect his targets\u2014especially Harry Potter. But Harry doesn\u2019t want to be protected. Even as the Ministry of Magic denies his claims, The Daily Prophet discredits him, and even Dumbledore won\u2019t look him in the eye, Harry grows more and more determined to fight his lifelong enemy Voldemort\u2014if only he had the \u201cweapon\u201d the Order is guarding.

the turn of the twentieth century the dramatic rise of mass media has profoundly transformed music practices in the Arab world. Music has adapted to successive forms of media disseminationfrom phonograph cylinders to MP3seach subjected to the political and economic forces of its particular era and region. Carried by mass media, the broader culture of Arab music has been thoroughly transformed as well. Simultaneously, mass mediated music has become a powerful social force. While parallel processes have unfolded worldwide, their implications in the Arabic-speaking world have thus far received little scholarly attention. This provocative volume features sixteen new essays examining these issues, especially televised music and the controversial new genre of the music video. Perceptive voicesboth emerging and establishedrepresent a wide variety of academic disciplines. Incisive essays by Egyptian critics display the textures of public Arabic discourse to an English readership.

Inspired by the Cervantes classic, Sam DuChamp, mediocre writer of spy thrillers, creates Quichotte, a courtly, addled salesman obsessed with television, who falls in impossible love with the TV star Salman R. Together with his (imaginary) son Sancho, Quichotte sets off on a picaresque quest across America to prove worthy of her hand, gallantly braving the tragicomic perils of an age where 'Anything-Can-Happen'. Meanwhile his creator, in a midlife crisis, has equally urgent challenges of his own. Just as Cervantes wrote Don Quixote to satirise the culture of his time, Rushdie takes the reader on a wild ride through a country on the verge of moral and spiritual collapse, with the kind of storytelling magic that is the hallmark of his work. The fully realised lives of DuChamp and Quichotte intertwine in a profoundly human quest for love and a wickedly entertaining portrait of an age in which fact is so often indiscernible from fiction. **A DAILY TELEGRAPH BOOK OF THE YEAR**","details":null,"author_id":182,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":500,"name":"Salman Rushdie","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1129,"category_id":4,"product_id":566,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1130,"category_id":5,"product_id":566,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":567,"title":"The Hunting Party","slug":"The-Hunting-Party","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=3VQCtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=3VQCtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780008297114","description":"*The Sunday Times Top 5 bestseller* EVERYONE'S INVITED.

Lauren Groff Words are important to Gretel, always have been. As a child, she lived on a canal boat with her mother, and together they invented a language that was just their own. She hasn't seen her mother since the age of sixteen, though - almost a lifetime ago - and those memories have faded. Now Gretel works as a lexicographer, updating dictionary entries, which suits her solitary nature. A phone call from the hospital interrupts Gretel's isolation and throws up questions from long ago. She begins to remember the private vocabulary of her childhood. She remembers other things, too: the wild years spent on the river; the strange, lonely boy who came to stay on the boat one winter; and the creature in the water - a canal thief? - swimming upstream, getting ever closer. In the end there will be nothing for Gretel to do but go back. Daisy Johnson's debut novel turns classical myth on its head and takes readers to a modern-day England unfamiliar to most. As daring as it is moving, Everything Under is a story of family and identity, of fate, language, love and belonging that leaves you unsettled and unstrung.","details":null,"author_id":184,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":375,"name":"Daisy Johnson","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1133,"category_id":4,"product_id":568,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1134,"category_id":5,"product_id":568,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":569,"title":"Blink","slug":"Blink","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=z7G13xBtfkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=z7G13xBtfkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780141014593","description":"Intuition is not some magical property that arises unbidden from the depths of our mind.

If it were 1995, it would be \"Why Amazon Is Going to Take Over the Retailing World\" . . . The Thank You Economy is about something big, something greater than any single revolutionary platform. It isn't some abstract concept or wacky business strategy\u2014it's real, and every one of us is doing business in it every day, whether we choose to recognize it or not. It's the way we communicate, the way we buy and sell, the way businesses and consumers interact online and offline. The Internet, where the Thank You Economy was born, has given consumers back their voice, and the tremendous power of their opinions via social media means that companies and brands have to compete on a whole different level than they used to. Gone are the days when a blizzard of marketing dollars could be used to overwhelm the airwaves, shut out the competition, and grab customer awareness. Now customers' demands for authenticity, originality, creativity, honesty, and good intent have made it necessary for companies and brands to revert to a level of customer service rarely seen since our great-grandparents' day, when business owners often knew their customers personally, and gave them individual attention. Here renowned entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk reveals how companies big and small can scale that kind of personal, one-on-one attention to their entire customer base, no matter how large, using the same social media platforms that carry consumer word of mouth. The Thank You Economy offers compelling, data-driven evidence that we have entered into an entirely new business era, one in which the companies that see the biggest returns won't be the ones that can throw the most money at an advertising campaign, but will be those that can prove they care about their customers more than anyone else. The businesses and brands that harness the word-of-mouth power from social media, those that can shift their culture to be more customer-aware and fan-friendly, will pull away from the pack and profit in today's markets. Filled with Vaynerchuk's irrepressible candor and wit, as well as real-world examples of companies that are profiting by putting Thank You Economy principles into practice, The Thank You Economy reveals how businesses can harness all the changes and challenges inherent in social media and turn them into tremendous opportunities for profit and growth.","details":null,"author_id":188,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":540,"name":"Gary Vaynerchuk","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1141,"category_id":4,"product_id":572,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1142,"category_id":5,"product_id":572,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":573,"title":"Without a Country","slug":"Without-a-Country","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=ZxGrswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=ZxGrswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781503900974","description":"From the international bestselling author of Last Train to Istanbul comes a novel based on true events that explores the depths of pride, devotion, and persistence as four generations of a family struggle to forge their destinies. As Hitler's reign of terror begins to loom large over Germany, Gerhard and Elsa Schliemann--like other German Jews--must flee with their children in search of sanctuary. But life elsewhere in Europe offers few opportunities for medical professor Gerhard and his fellow scientists. Then they discover an unexpected haven in Turkey, where universities and hospitals welcome them as valuable assets. But despite embracing their adopted land, personal and political troubles persist. Military coups bring unrest and uncertainty to the country, intermarriage challenges the cultural identity of Gerhard and Elsa's descendants, and anti-Semitism once again threatens their future in the place they call home.

The Commandant at Birkenau, Schwarzhuber, notices her long beautiful hair, and forces her separation from the other women prisoners. Cilka learns quickly that power, even unwillingly given, equals survival. After liberation, Cilka is charged as a collaborator for sleeping with the enemy and sent to a desolate, brutal prison camp in Siberia known as Vorkuta, inside the Arctic Circle. Innocent and imprisoned once again, Cilka faces challenges both new and horribly familiar. When she makes an impression on a female doctor, Cilka is taken under her wing and begins to tend to the ill in the camp, struggling to care for them under unimaginable conditions. Cilka finds endless resources within herself as she confronts death and faces terror, each day a battle for survival. And when she nurses a man called Aleksandr, Cilka finds that despite everything that has happened to her, there is room in her heart for love. Based on what is known of Cilka's time in Auschwitz, and on the experience of women in Siberian prison camps, Cilka's Journey is the breathtaking sequel to The Tattooist of Auschwitz. A powerful testament to the triumph of the human will in adversity, Cilka's Journey will make you weep, but it will also leave you with the remarkable story of one woman's fierce determination to survive, against all odds.","details":null,"author_id":190,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":375,"name":"Heather Morris","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1145,"category_id":4,"product_id":574,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1146,"category_id":5,"product_id":574,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":575,"title":"It's the Manager","slug":"It's-the-Manager","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=UJc1vgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=UJc1vgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781595622242","description":"Packed with 52 discoveries from Gallup\u2019s largest study on the future of work, It\u2019s the Manager shows leaders how to adapt their organizations to rapid change, ranging from new workplace demands to managing remote employees, a diverse workforce, the rise of artificial intelligence, gig workers, and attracting \u2013 and keeping \u2013 today\u2019s best employees.

There have been exhilarating highs and devastating lows, but his love for the practice of neurosurgery has never wavered. Prompted by his retirement from his full-time job in the NHS, and through his continuing work in Nepal and Ukraine, Henry has been forced to reflect more deeply about what forty years spent handling the human brain has taught him. Moving between encounters with patients in his London hospital, to those he treats in the more extreme circumstances of his work abroad, Henry faces up to the burden of responsibility that can come with trying to reduce human suffering. Unearthing memories of his early days as a medical student, and the experiences that shaped him as a young surgeon, he explores the difficulties of a profession that deals in probabilities rather than certainties, and where the overwhelming urge to prolong life can come at a tragic cost for both patients and for those who love them.

They escape the island together, but then then Titch disappears and Washington must make his way alone, following the promise of freedom further than he ever dreamed possible. From the blistering cane fields of Barbados to the icy wastes of the Canadian Arctic, from the mud-drowned streets of London to the eerie deserts of Morocco, Washington Black teems with all the strangeness and mystery of life. Inspired by a true story, Washington Black is the extraordinary tale of a world destroyed and made whole again.","details":null,"author_id":197,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":375,"name":"Esi Edugyan","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1159,"category_id":4,"product_id":581,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1160,"category_id":5,"product_id":581,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":582,"title":"The Overstory","slug":"The-Overstory","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=jO7FwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=jO7FwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781785151637","description":"SHORTLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE 2018'Autumn makes me think of leaves, which makes me think of trees, which makes me think of The Overstory,the best novel ever written about trees, and really, just one of the best novels, period.? - Ann Patchett'It's a masterpiece.' - Tim Winton'It?s not possible for Powers to write an uninteresting book.' - Margaret AtwoodA monumental novel about trees and people by one of our most 'prodigiously talented' (The New York Times Book Review) novelists.The Overstoryunfolds in concentric rings of interlocking fables that range from antebellum New York to the late twentieth-century Timber Wars of the Pacific Northwest and beyond-An Air Force loadmaster in the Vietnam War is shot out of the sky, then saved by falling into a banyan.An artist inherits a hundred years of photographic portraits, all of the same doomed American chestnut.A hard-partying undergraduate in the late 1980s electrocutes herself, dies and is sent back into life by creatures of air and light.A hearing- and speech-impaired scientist discovers that trees are communicating with one another.These four, and five other strangers - each summoned in different ways by trees - are brought together in a last and violent stand to save the continent?s few remaining acres of virgin forest.There is a world alongside ours - vast, slow, interconnected, resourceful, magnificently inventive and almost invisible to us.

One morning, Nadia's eye catches sight of a post in the daily paper: To the cute girl with the coffee stains on her dress. I'm the guy who's always standing near the doors... Drink sometime? So begins a not-quite-romance of near-misses, true love, and the power of the written word. A #1 ebook bestseller, this wonderful will-they-won't-they romance is perfect for those who loved Beth O'Leary's The Flatshare and Mhairi McFarlane's Don't You Forget About Me. ****** What readers are saying about Our Stop...

What will she do? And what are the implications for her behaviour later in life? Walter Mischel's now iconic 'marshmallow test,' one of the most famous experiments in the history of psychology, proved that the ability to delay gratification is critical to living a successful and fulfilling life: self-control not only predicts higher marks in school, better social and cognitive functioning, and a greater sense of self-worth; it also helps us manage stress, pursue goals more effectively, and cope with painful emotions. But is willpower prewired, or can it be taught? In his groundbreaking new book, Dr. Mischel draws on decades of compelling research and life examples to explore the nature of willpower, identifying the cognitive skills and mental mechanisms that enable it and showing how these can be applied to challenges in everyday life--from weight control to quitting smoking, overcoming heartbreak, making major decisions, and planning for retirement. With profound implications for the choices we make in parenting, education, public policy and self-care, The Marshmallow Test will change the way we think about who we are and what we can be. And since, as Mischel argues, a life with too much self-control can be as unfulfilling as one with too little, this book will also teach you when it's time to ring the bell and enjoy that marshmallow.","details":null,"author_id":221,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":250,"name":"Walter Mischel","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1209,"category_id":4,"product_id":606,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1210,"category_id":5,"product_id":606,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":607,"title":"The Guest List","slug":"The-Guest-List","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=S3w4zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=S3w4zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780008297190","description":"","details":null,"author_id":183,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":225,"name":"Lucy Foley","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1211,"category_id":4,"product_id":607,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1212,"category_id":5,"product_id":607,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":608,"title":"Me Before You","slug":"Me-Before-You","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=8GNA-OzYFuwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=8GNA-OzYFuwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780718157838","description":"Lou Clark knows lots of things.

As Erika and her team start digging deeper, they discover a calculated serial killer - stalking their victims before choosing the right moment to strike.

Porter\u2019s groundbreaking study of international competitiveness has shaped national policy in countries around the world. It has also transformed thinking and action in states, cities, companies, and even entire regions such as Central America. Based on research in ten leading trading nations, The Competitive Advantage of Nations offers the first theory of competitiveness based on the causes of the productivity with which companies compete. Porter shows how traditional comparative advantages such as natural resources and pools of labor have been superseded as sources of prosperity, and how broad macroeconomic accounts of competitiveness are insufficient. The book introduces Porter\u2019s \u201cdiamond,\u201d a whole new way to understand the competitive position of a nation (or other locations) in global competition that is now an integral part of international business thinking. Porter's concept of \u201cclusters,\u201d or groups of interconnected firms, suppliers, related industries, and institutions that arise in particular locations, has become a new way for companies and governments to think about economies, assess the competitive advantage of locations, and set public policy. Even before publication of the book, Porter\u2019s theory had guided national reassessments in New Zealand and elsewhere. His ideas and personal involvement have shaped strategy in countries as diverse as the Netherlands, Portugal, Taiwan, Costa Rica, and India, and regions such as Massachusetts, California, and the Basque country. Hundreds of cluster initiatives have flourished throughout the world. In an era of intensifying global competition, this pathbreaking book on the new wealth of nations has become the standard by which all future work must be measured.","details":null,"author_id":242,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":520,"name":"Michael E.

Connie is bold and alluring, a successful writer whose novel is being turned into a major Hollywood film. Elise follows Connie to LA, a city of strange dreams and swimming pools and late-night gatherings of glamorous people. But whilst Connie thrives on the heat and electricity of this new world where everyone is reaching for the stars and no one is telling the truth, Elise finds herself floundering. When she overhears a conversation at a party that turns everything on its head, Elise makes an impulsive decision that will change her life forever.Three decades later, Rose Simmons is seeking answers about her mother, who disappeared when she was a baby. Having learned that the last person to see her was Constance Holden, a reclusive novelist who withdrew from public life at the peak of her fame, Rose is drawn to the door of Connie's imposing house in search of a confession ... From the million-copy bestselling author of The Miniaturist and The Muse, this is a luminous, powerful and deeply moving novel about secrets and storytelling, motherhood and friendship, and how we lose and find ourselves.PRAISE FOR THE CONFESSION 'Dazzlingly good. The Confession is that rare thing: an utterly engrossing novel which asks big questions without ever once losing sight of the storyteller's need to entertain and move.

From words of comfort to advice for the lovelorn, you can bet that someone, somewhere has come up with phraseology that perfectly sums up whatever situation you find yourself in and put it more succinctly than you could ever dream of.In All That Glisters . Caroline Taggart presents some of the pithiest, wisest and most fascinating quotations we should all know, detailing where the quotation has come from and why it may be useful when searching for an elegant or informed line to illustrate a point, spice up conversation or impress one's friends.Part of the pleasure of this book is to reveal the provenance of the well-worn quote (or misquote) - my cup runneth over, ay, there's the rub, to err is human, the spice of life - but also to introduce some less familiar ones. Most of the quotations included are from classic sources - from the Bible, the works of Shakespeare, other poets, classical authors, Dickens (God bless us everyone, waiting for something to turn up, very humble), Charlotte Bronte (Reader, I married him) and George Bernard Shaw (who didn't actually say Youth is wasted on the young, but may have said something like it. Somewhere.

The bloody, devastating civil wars set family against family, friend against friend. At the head of this disintegrating kingdom was Charles I. His rule would change the face of the monarchy for ever. Charles I's reign is one of the most dramatic in history, yet Charles the man remains elusive. Too often he is recalled as weak and stupid, his wife, Henrietta Maria, as spoilt and silly: the cause of his ruin. In this portrait -- informed by newly disclosed manuscripts, including letters between the king and his queen -- Leanda de Lisle uncovers a Charles I who was principled and brave, but also fatally blinkered. He is revealed as a complex man who pays the price for bringing radical change; Henrietta Maria as a warrior queen and political player as impressive as any Tudor. Here too are the cousins who befriended and betrayed them: the peacocking Henry Holland, whose brother engineered the king's fall; and the magnetic 'last Boleyn girl', Lucy Carlisle. This is a tragic story for our times, of populist politicians and religious war, of a new media and the reshaping of nations, in which women vied with men for power. For Charles it ended on the scaffold. Condemned as a traitor and murderer, he was also heralded as a martyr: his reign destined to sow the seeds of democracy across Britain and the New World.","details":null,"author_id":294,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":500,"name":"Leanda de Lisle","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1383,"category_id":4,"product_id":693,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1384,"category_id":5,"product_id":693,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":694,"title":"I Made a Mistake","slug":"I-Made-a-Mistake","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=PETTxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=PETTxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780241984659","description":"IT STARTED WITH A KISS...

Published to coincide with this 'remarkable achievement' and in the anniversary year, Dear Mr Murray is a collection of some of the best letters from the hundreds of thousands held in the John Murray Archive. They reveal not only the story of some of the most interesting and influential books in history but also the remarkable friendships - as well as occasional animosities - between author and publisher, as well as readers, editors, printers and illustrators. Despite the incredible number of letters that were retained by the Murray family, some failed to arrive, others were delayed and some barely survived, but longevity added to the reputation and fame of John Murray and a correspondent in Canada who addressed his letter merely to 'John Murray, The World-wide famous Book & Publishing House, London, England' as early as 1932 could be confident that his letter would arrive. Intended to entertain and inspire, and spanning more than two hundred years, Dear Mr Murray is full of literary history and curiosities: from Charles Darwin's response to the negative reviews of On the Origin of Species to Adrian Conan Doyle challenging Harold Nicolson to a duel for insulting his father in the press; from David Livingstone's displeasure at the proposed drawing of a lion to represent his near-death encounter in Missionary Travels to William Makepeace Thackeray apologising for his drunken behaviour; from Byron berating John Murray for being fooled by his girlfriend's forgery of his signature to the poet James Hogg so desperate for money that he claims he won't be able to afford a Christmas goose; and from Jane Austen expressing concern about printing delays to Patrick Leigh Fermor beseeching Jock Murray not to visit him until he'd completed A Time of Gifts.

There she endured unimaginable experiences, including being made to dance for the infamous Josef Mengele. Over the coming months, her bravery helped her sister to survive and led to her bunkmates rescuing her during a death march. When their camp was finally liberated, Edith was pulled from a pile of bodies, barely alive. In The Choice, Edith Eger shares her life, remarkable because her years in the concentration camp encouraged her to find a hope and resilience that most of us would never think was possible. It wasn't easy but, as she tried to find a future for herself after the Second World War, partly by helping many others through their own versions of trauma, she discovered an honesty, strength and empowerment within herself that makes for a memorable and inspiring read. Compelling, truly remarkable, and ultimately triumphant, The Choice is the unforgettable memoir of a woman who has seen the worst and lived the best.","details":null,"author_id":312,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":250,"name":"Edith Eger","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1431,"category_id":4,"product_id":717,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1432,"category_id":5,"product_id":717,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":718,"title":"The Lost Child","slug":"The-Lost-Child","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=VT4-wwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=VT4-wwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781472255051","description":"A tragic death.

In Covey's experience, the thing that most undermines the ability to execute goals is what he calls the Whirlwind: those urgent tasks that must be done simply to keep an organization alive. As Covey shows, the only way to execute new, important goals is to separate those goals from the Whirlwind. The Four Disciplines allow leaders to create a strategy that requires a change in behaviour, since only by ensuring that everyone on the team understands the goal, knows what to do to reach it and knows whether progress is being made, will a leader produce consistent breakthrough results while sustaining the urgent work of the Whirlwind. The Four Disciplines of Execution are:1. Focus on the Wildly Important; 2. Act on the Lead Measures; 3. Keep a Compelling Scoreboard; 4. Create a Cadence of Accountability. For more than a decade FranklinCovey has been studying what it takes to achieve important goals, and in this book they share success stories from a wide range of companies that have implemented the Four Disciplines to result in greater profits, increased market share and improved customer satisfaction. This way of thinking is essential to any company that wants to not only weather, but thrive in this economy.","details":null,"author_id":316,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":225,"name":"Sean Covey","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1439,"category_id":4,"product_id":721,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1440,"category_id":5,"product_id":721,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":722,"title":"Peaky Blinders","slug":"Peaky-Blinders","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=3miGxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=3miGxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781789461725","description":"","details":null,"author_id":317,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":225,"name":"Carl Chinn","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1441,"category_id":4,"product_id":722,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1442,"category_id":5,"product_id":722,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":723,"title":"The Eyes of Darkness","slug":"The-Eyes-of-Darkness","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=6mezjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=6mezjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781472240293","description":"If you delight in the suspense of Stephen King and The Stranger by Harlan Coben chilled you to the bone (in the best possible way), you'll love The Eyes of Darkness - the classic thriller by Sunday Times and New York Times bestselling author Dean Koontz.

Feist. The world of Garn once boasted five great kingdoms, until the King of Ithrace was defeated and every member of his family executed by Lodavico, the ruthless King of Sandura, a man with ambitions to rule the world. Ithrace's ruling family were the legendary Firemanes, and represented a great danger to the other kings. Now four great kingdoms remain, on the brink of war. But rumour has it that the newborn son of the last king of Ithrace survived, carried off during battle and sequestered by the Quelli Nacosti, a secret society whose members are trained to infiltrate and spy upon the rich and powerful throughout Garn. Terrified that this may be true, and that the child will grow to maturity with bloody revenge in his heart, the four kings have placed a huge bounty on the child's head. In the small village of Oncon, Declan is apprenticed to a master blacksmith, learning the secrets of producing the mythical king's steel. Oncon is situated in the Covenant, a neutral region lying between two warring kingdoms. Since the Covenant was declared, the region has existed in peace, until violence explodes as slavers descend upon the village to capture young men to press as soldiers for Sandura. Declan must escape, to take his priceless knowledge to Baron Daylon Dumarch, ruler of Marquensas, perhaps the only man who can defeat Lodavico of Sandura, who has now allied himself with the fanatical Church of the One, which is marching across the continent, imposing its extreme form of religion upon the population and burning unbelievers as they go. Meanwhile, on the island of Coaltachin, the secret domain of the Quelli Nacosti, three friends are being schooled in the deadly arts of espionage and assassination: Donte, son of one of the most powerful masters of the order; Hava, a serious girl with fighting abilities that can set any opponent on their back; and Hatu, a strange, conflicted lad in whom fury and calm war constantly, whose hair is a bright and fiery shade of red...","details":null,"author_id":322,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":225,"name":"Raymond E.

A group of old university friends leave the bright lights of London and travel to Unst, Shetland's most northerly island, to celebrate the marriage of one of their friends to a Shetlander. But late on the night of the wedding party, one of them, Eleanor, disappears - apparently into thin air. It's mid-summer, a time of light nights and unexpected mists. The following day, Eleanor's friend Polly receives an email. It appears to be a suicide note, saying she'll never be found alive. And then Eleanor's body is discovered, lying in a small loch close to the cliff edge. Detectives Jimmy Perez and Willow Reeves are dispatched to Unst to investigate. Before she went missing, Eleanor claimed to have seen the ghost of a local child who drowned in the 1920s. Her interest in the ghost had seemed unhealthy - obsessive, even - to her friends: an indication of a troubled mind. But Jimmy and Willow are convinced that there is more to Eleanor's death than they first thought. Is there a secret that lies behind the myth? One so shocking that someone would kill - many years later - to protect? Ann Cleeves' striking Shetland novel explores the tensions between tradition and modernity that lie deep at the heart of a community, and how events from the past can have devastating effects on the present.Also available in the Shetland series are Raven Black, White Nights, Red Bones, Blue Lightning and Dead Water.","details":null,"author_id":333,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":200,"name":"Ann Cleeves","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1493,"category_id":4,"product_id":748,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1494,"category_id":5,"product_id":748,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":749,"title":"Bring Me Back","slug":"Bring-Me-Back","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=TJCHswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=TJCHswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780008244873","description":"The million-copy bestselling author returns with a breathtaking thriller.

In Unfu*k Yourself, Gary John Bishop told us it was time to stop making excuses- to recognize and take responsibility for the negative self-talk holding us back. In Stop Doing That Sh*t, he builds on that message, teaching us how to stop self-sabotaging behavior. Bishop explains how our destructive cycles come down to the way that we're wired. He then identifies different types of people and the ways we fu*k ourselves over: We can't save money. We land in the same type of toxic relationship. We're stuck in a rut at work. Analysing why we act the way we do, including what our common grenades are that blow up our lives, Bishop then shows how we can interrupt the cycle and stop self-sabotaging our lives. Written in the same in your face style as Unfu*k Yourself, Stop Doing that Sh*t will help us get in touch with our psychological machinery so we learn to interrupt negative thoughts and behaviour before they start, allowing us to give our attention to something else, and start to find success in the areas we thought we never could. We can take back our lives. We may have fu*ked up in the past, but Stop Doing That Sh*t will show us how to break the patterns in order to live the lives we yearn to have.","details":null,"author_id":338,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":375,"name":"Gary John Bishop","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1509,"category_id":4,"product_id":756,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1510,"category_id":5,"product_id":756,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":757,"title":"FURIES.","slug":"FURIES.","thumbnail":"","image":"","isbn":"9780008288983","description":"","details":null,"author_id":339,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":325,"name":"KATIE.

People may know of Sackville West's novels, or her passion for gardening, or her relationship with Virginia Woolf, but few know of her efforts to boost the morale of her beloved England during World War II. Sackville-West spent her childhood years at Knole House, a stately country home that deeply influenced her life and work. In entertaining and accessible prose she brings a deep affection to the task of boosting the morale of a country beset by war. This volume in the Britain in Pictures series is a love letter to the elegant homes of the English countryside and served as a balm to a besieged country. Writing at the height of the Blitz, as cities lay in smoldering ruins after relentless bombing, Sackville-West demonstrates a yearning for the safety provided by these exceptional buildings. We discover the architecture of the stately houses, with details conveyed in such entertaining and vivid prose that the buildings and surrounding areas come to life. The story is not just about the buildings, however, but also about the people who built and lived in them, from the most common of squires to the highest-born kings and queens. Equal parts architectural history and cultural history, this insider's view is quintessentially British. Its elegant package, with a ribbon for bookmarking, makes it the perfect gift for any Anglophile.","details":null,"author_id":343,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":275,"name":"Vita Sackville-West","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1521,"category_id":4,"product_id":762,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1522,"category_id":5,"product_id":762,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":763,"title":"I Know My Name","slug":"I-Know-My-Name","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=uYRwvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=uYRwvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780008237530","description":"...But what if that's the only thing you can remember?

Their bond is stronger than ever, but every new challenge they face shakes their foundation--and Hardin's impenetrable fa\u00e7ade--to the core. As the shocking truth about each of their families emerges, it's clear the two lovers are not so different from each other.

ENTER THE WORLD OF STEPHEN FRY'S SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER, HEROES In this companion to his bestselling Mythos, Stephen Fry gloriously retells the epic myths of the Greek heroes - which will be loved by young and old alike. 'An odyssey through Greek mythology. Brilliant . . . all hail Stephen Fry' Daily Mail ___________ Few mere mortals have ever embarked on such bold and heart-stirring adventures, overcome myriad monstrous perils, or outwitted scheming vengeful gods, quite as stylishly and triumphantly as Greek heroes. In this companion to his bestselling Mythos, Stephen Fry brilliantly retells these dramatic, funny, tragic and timeless tales. Join Jason aboard the Argo as he quests for the Golden Fleece. See Atalanta - who was raised by bears - outrun any man before being tricked with golden apples. Witness wily Oedipus solve the riddle of the Sphinx and discover how Bellerophon captures the winged horse Pegasus to help him slay the monster Chimera. Filled with white-knuckle chases and battles, impossible puzzles and riddles, acts of base cowardice and real bravery, not to mention murders and selfless sacrifices, Heroes is the story of what we mortals are truly capable of - at our worst and our very best. 'A romp through the lives of ancient Greek gods. Fry is at his story-telling best . . . the gods will be pleased' Times 'Assured and engaging. The pace is lively, the jokes are genuinely funny' Guardian 'An Olympian feat. The gods seem to be smiling on Fry - his myths are definitely a hit' Evening Standard 'Just as delightful and difficult to put down as the first. Heroes makes the stories relatable without skimping on the gory details, or sacrificing the truths of the myth. It's rich, it's funny and you'll feel like you've learned a lot' Herald ___________ If you like the sound of Heroes, you'll love Mythos - Fry's first foray into the enthralling world of Greek mythology. Praise for Mythos: 'Ebullient and funny' Times 'Entertaining and edifying' Daily Telegraph 'A rollicking good read' Independent 'The Greek gods of the past become relatable as pop culture, modern literature and music are woven throughout.

He saved hundreds of lives over the course of a thirty-five year career and now, in his astounding memoir, Westaby details some of his most remarkable and poignant cases - such as the baby who had suffered multiple heart attacks by six months old, a woman who lived the nightmare of locked-in syndrome, and a man whose life was powered by a battery for eight years.

Despite dating from the 4th century BC, The Art of Rhetoric continues to be regarded by many as the single most important work on the art of persuasion. As democracy began emerging in 5th-century Athens, public speaking and debate became an increasingly important tool to garner influence in the assemblies, councils, and law courts of ancient Greece. In response to this, both politicians and ordinary citizens became desperate to learn greater skills in this area, as well as the philosophy behind it. This treatise was one of the first to provide just that, establishing methods and observations of informal reasoning and style, and has continued to be hugely influential on public speaking and philosophy today. Aristotle, the grandfather of philosophy, student of Plato, and teacher of Alexander the Great, was one of the first people to create a comprehensive system of philosophy, encompassing logic, morality, aesthetics, politics, ethics, and science. Although written over 2,000 years ago, The Art of Rhetoric remains a comprehensive introduction for philosophy students into the subject of rhetoric, as well as a useful manual for anyone today looking to improve their oratory skills of persuasion.","details":null,"author_id":435,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":50,"name":"Aristotle","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1821,"category_id":4,"product_id":912,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1822,"category_id":5,"product_id":912,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":913,"title":"The Age of Innocence","slug":"The-Age-of-Innocence","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=pXy4L4u7ZFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=pXy4L4u7ZFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780007368648","description":"Tale of the manners and morals of New York society in the later 1800s.

When Robert Fagles' translation of The Iliad was published in 1990, critics and scholars alike hailed it as a masterpiece. Here, one of the great modern translators presents us with The Odyssey, Homer's best-loved poem, recounting Odysseus' wanderings after the Trojan War. With wit and wile, the 'man of twists and turns' meets the challenges of the sea-god Poseidon, and monsters ranging from the many-headed Scylla to the cannibalistic Cyclops Polyphemus - only to return after twenty years to a home besieged by his wife Penelope's suitors. In the myths and legends retold in this immortal poem, Fagles has captured the energy of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom. Seven greek cities claim the honour of being the birthplace of Homer (c. 8th-7th century BC), the poet to whom the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey are attributed. The Iliad is the oldest surviving work of Western literature, but the identity - or even the existence - of Homer himself is a complete mystery, with no reliable biographical information having survived. If you enjoyed The Odyssey, you might like Robert Fagles' translation of The Iliad, also available in Penguin Classics. 'Wonderfully readable ... Just the right blend of roughness and sophistication' Ted Hughes 'A memorable achievement ... Mr Fagles has been remarkably successful in finding a style that is of our time and yet timeless' Richard Jenkyns, The New York Times Book Review 'His translation of The Odyssey is his best work yet' Garry Wills, New Yorker","details":null,"author_id":454,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":50,"name":"Homer","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1873,"category_id":4,"product_id":938,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1874,"category_id":5,"product_id":938,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":939,"title":"Think Big","slug":"Think-Big","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=Pa5ySAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=Pa5ySAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780062022394","description":"Donald J.

Everyone. Right now' Patrick NessCuckoo Song by Frances Hardinge, the Costa Award-winning author of The Lie Tree, is a fantastically eerie and beautifully written novel, and was shortlisted for the prestigious Carnegie Medal.The first things to shift were the doll's eyes, the beautiful grey-green glass eyes. Slowly they swivelled, until their gaze was resting on Triss's face. Then the tiny mouth moved, opened to speak. 'What are you doing here?' It was uttered in tones of outrage and surprise, and in a voice as cold and musical as the clinking of cups. 'Who do you think you are? This is my family.'

Our brains are far stranger than we think. We take it for granted that we can remember, feel emotion, navigate, empathise and understand the world around us, but how would our lives change if these abilities were dramatically enhanced - or disappeared overnight?

Delving into the rich histories of these conditions, exploring the very latest research and cutting-edge medical techniques, Thomson explains the workings of our consciousness, our emotions, our creativity and even the mechanisms that allow us to understand our own existence.

Guardian 'In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I've often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net. Now I'm letting my guard down.' - Hillary Rodham Clinton, from the introduction of What Happened For the first time, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals what she was thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history. Now free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference and an opponent who broke all the rules. This is her most personal memoir yet. In these pages, she describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterwards. With humour and candour, she tells readers what it took to get back on her feet - the rituals, relationships and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics. She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on democracy by a foreign adversary. By analysing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect their values and democracy in the future. The election of 2016 was unprecedented and historic. What Happened is the story of that campaign and its aftermath - both a deeply intimate account and a cautionary tale.","details":null,"author_id":474,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":500,"name":"Hillary Rodham Clinton","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1951,"category_id":4,"product_id":977,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1952,"category_id":5,"product_id":977,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":978,"title":"An Orchestra of Minorities","slug":"An-Orchestra-of-Minorities","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=o3ACtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=o3ACtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781408710807","description":"LONGLISTED FOR THE BOOKER PRIZE 2019 FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOKER-SHORTLISTED NOVEL, THE FISHERMEN 'Obioma is truly the heir to Chinua Achebe' New York Times A young farmer named Chinonso prevents a woman from falling to her death.

WHEN ESTHER THOREL, the wife of a Huguenot silk-weaver, rescues Sara Kemp from a brothel she thinks she is doing God's will. Sara is not convinced being a maid is better than being a whore, but the chance to escape her grasping 'madam' is too good to refuse. INSIDE THE THORELS' tall house in Spitalfields, where the strange cadence of the looms fills the attic, the two women forge an uneasy relationship. The physical intimacies of washing and dressing belie the reality: Sara despises her mistress's blindness to the hypocrisy of her household, while Esther is too wrapped up in her own secrets to see Sara as anything more than another charitable cause. IT IS SILK that has Esther so distracted. For years she has painted her own designs, dreaming that one day her husband will weave them into reality. When he laughs at her ambition, she unwittingly sets in motion events that will change the fate of the whole Thorel household and set the scene for a devastating day of reckoning between her and Sara.

Now she brings the iconic story to a dramatic conclusion in this riveting sequel. More than fifteen years after the events of The Handmaid's Tale, the theocratic regime of the Republic of Gilead maintains its grip on power, but there are signs it is beginning to rot from within. At this crucial moment, the lives of three radically different women converge, with potentially explosive results. Two have grown up as part of the first generation to come of age in the new order. The testimonies of these two young women are joined by a third voice: a woman who wields power through the ruthless accumulation and deployment of secrets. As Atwood unfolds The Testaments, she opens up the innermost workings of Gilead as each woman is forced to come to terms with who she is, and how far she will go for what she believes.

Having spent years interviewing imprisoned criminals, including notorious serial killers, he discovered that the lack of remorse they showed was in many ways more terrifying than the crimes they had committed. Yet in the course of these conversations, the author also had the chance to interview his subjects' psychiatrists and, in doing so, uncovered a terrible truth: a monster can be hidden behind a friendly face. Some of these experts, he found, proved to have more in common with their patients than he would ever have expected. This book examines horrific crimes committed by some of the most remorseless and merciless people ever to have lived. If it reveals a mindset wholly alien to most people, it also, shockingly, demonstrates that some of the people who treat these psychopaths have their own demons. Talking with Psychopaths will inevitably shift the reader's view of psychopaths, and in doing so, reveals that horror can be much closer to us than we think.","details":null,"author_id":485,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":200,"name":"Christopher Berry-Dee","top":0,"categories":[{"id":1987,"category_id":4,"product_id":995,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":1988,"category_id":5,"product_id":995,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":996,"title":"Not a Diet Book","slug":"Not-a-Diet-Book","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=f2uMzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=f2uMzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780008374297","description":"*The No.1 Sunday Times Bestseller James Smith has already changed thousands of lives with his international phenomenon Not A Diet Book.

How can we originate new ideas, policies and practices without risking it all? Adam Grant shows how to improve the world by championing novel ideas and values that go against the grain, battling conformity, and bucking outdated traditions. Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how to recognise a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders can fight group think to build cultures that welcome dissent. Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his startups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticise him, and a TV executive who didn't even work in comedy but saved Seinfeld from the cutting room floor.

She spent her infancy in extreme poverty, and when her mother died giving birth to a baby brother, Chika was brought to the Have Faith Haiti Orphanage that Mitch and his wife, Janine operate. Chika's arrival made a quick impression. Brave and self-assured, even as a three-year-old, she delighted the other kids and teachers. But at age five, Chika was suddenly diagnosed with a terminal disease that no doctor in Haiti could help with. Mitch and Janine took Chika to America, hoping that treatment there would enable her to go back home. Instead, Chika became a permanent part of their lives, as they embarked on a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure. As Chika's boundless optimism and humour taught Mitch the joys of caring for a child, he learnt that a relationship built on love, no matter what blows it takes, can never be lost. This is Mitch Albom at his most poignant, powerful and personal. Chika is a celebration of a girl, her adoptive guardians, and the incredible bond they formed - a devastatingly beautiful portrait of what it means to be a family, regardless of how it is made.","details":null,"author_id":304,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":375,"name":"Mitch Albom","top":0,"categories":[{"id":2041,"category_id":4,"product_id":1022,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":2042,"category_id":5,"product_id":1022,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":1023,"title":"Postscript","slug":"Postscript","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=pldBygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=pldBygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780008194901","description":"The long-awaited sequel to the international bestseller PS, I Love You.

You are doing well in your field. But there is something standing between you and the next level of achievement. That something may just be one of your own annoying habits.Perhaps one small flaw - a behaviour you barely even recognise - is the only thing that's keeping you from where you want to be. It may be that the very characteristic that you believe got you where you are - like the drive to win at all costs - is what's holding you back. As this book explains, people often do well in spite of certain habits rather than because of them-and need a \"to stop\" list rather than one listing what \"to do\".Marshall Goldsmith's expertise is in helping global leaders overcome their unconscious annoying habits and become more successful. His one-on-one coaching comes with a six-figure price tag - but in this book you get his great advice for much less. Recently named as one of the world's five most-respected executive coaches by Forbes, he has worked with over 100 major CEOs and their management teams at the world's top businesses.

'The rock memoir of the decade' Daily Mail 'The rock star's gloriously entertaining and candid memoir is a gift to the reader' Sunday Times In his first and only official autobiography, music icon Elton John reveals the truth about his extraordinary life. Me is the the joyously funny, honest and moving story of the most enduringly successful singer\/songwriter of all time. ______________ Christened Reginald Dwight, he was a shy boy with Buddy Holly glasses who grew up in the London suburb of Pinner and dreamed of becoming a pop star. By the age of twenty-three, he was performing his first gig in America, facing an astonished audience in his bright yellow dungarees, a star-spangled T-shirt and boots with wings. Elton John had arrived and the music world would never be the same again. His life has been full of drama, from the early rejection of his work with songwriting partner Bernie Taupin to spinning out of control as a chart-topping superstar; from half-heartedly trying to drown himself in his LA swimming pool to disco-dancing with the Queen; from friendships with John Lennon, Freddie Mercury and George Michael to setting up his AIDS Foundation. All the while, Elton was hiding a drug addiction that would grip him for over a decade. In Me Elton also writes powerfully about getting clean and changing his life, about finding love with David Furnish and becoming a father. In a voice that is warm, humble and open, this is Elton on his music and his relationships, his passions and his mistakes. This is a story that will stay with you, by a living legend. ______________ 'Self-deprecating, funny . . .

Find out what truly makes a psychopath, from the leading expert who helped to create Killing Eve's Villanelle. Dr Mark Freestone has worked on some of the most interesting, infamous and disturbing psychopath cases of recent times and is now sharing his phenomenal insight. Danny 'the Borderline' switches from grandiosity to rage to despair within minutes and killed his defenceless friend without explanation. Tony 'the Conman' prefers charm, intimidation and sexual abuse over physical violence and once tried to dupe someone into buying the Eiffel Tower. Jason 'the Liar' had a fantasy life that led to vicious murders around Europe and preys on those who see the good in people.

So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.

When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.

'A compelling read' - Financial Times 'A sporadically absorbing, pleasingly vengeful and often darkly funny account of one woman's bid for presidential history.' Sunday Times 'Her new book is more gossipy, it is meaner, more entertaining and more wrong-headed than anything she or her speechwriters have written before.' Observer 'What Happened is highly entertaining. It is spirited, well-written and informative.' Guardian 'In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I've often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net. Now I'm letting my guard down.' - Hillary Rodham Clinton, from the introduction of What Happened For the first time, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals what she was thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history. Now free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference and an opponent who broke all the rules. This is her most personal memoir yet. In these pages, she describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterwards. With humour and candour, she tells readers what it took to get back on her feet - the rituals, relationships and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics. She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on democracy by a foreign adversary. By analysing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect their values and democracy in the future. The election of 2016 was unprecedented and historic. What Happened is the story of that campaign and its aftermath - both a deeply intimate account and a cautionary tale.","details":null,"author_id":474,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":275,"name":"Hillary Rodham Clinton","top":0,"categories":[{"id":2109,"category_id":4,"product_id":1056,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":2110,"category_id":5,"product_id":1056,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":1057,"title":"Beautiful Bitch","slug":"Beautiful-Bitch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=QjQoC1ogyhcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=QjQoC1ogyhcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781476754147","description":"Chloe Mills and Bennett Ryan continue their love-hate relationship in a French villa.","details":null,"author_id":515,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":200,"name":"Christina Lauren","top":0,"categories":[{"id":2111,"category_id":4,"product_id":1057,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":2112,"category_id":5,"product_id":1057,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":1058,"title":"Unrest","slug":"Unrest","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=N-d0tAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=N-d0tAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781471172205","description":"'SPOOKY.

Other times he is the one moving around, while his body lies asleep on the bed. According to his doctor, sleep paralysis and out of body experiences are harmless - but to Elliot they're terrifying. Convinced that his brush with death has opened up connections with the spirit world, Elliott secures a live-in job at one of England's most haunted locations, determined to find out the truth. There he finds Sebastian, the ghost of a long-dead servant boy hanged for stealing bread. He also meets the living, breathing Ophelia, a girl with secrets of her own. She and Elliott grow closer, but things take a terrifying turn when Elliott discovers Sebastian is occupying his body when he leaves it. And the more time Sebastian spends inhabiting a living body, the more resistant he becomes to giving it back. Worse, he seems to have an unhealthy interest in Ophelia.

Can you love someone you can never touch? Stella Grant likes to be in control - even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. At this point, what Stella needs to control most is keeping herself away from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. No exceptions. The only thing Will Newman wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn't care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical drug trial. Soon, he'll turn eighteen and then he'll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals. Will's exactly what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as breathes on Stella she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart.

J\ufffdrgen Gr\ufffdbler's Olympic coaching career is one of legend, yet the man himself has remained resolutely out of the spotlight. Over the last twenty years he has masterminded British Rowing's incomparable success. And when the difference between gold and silver can mean mere fractions of a second, J\ufffdrgen Gr\ufffdbler, and his more power mantra, has achieved gloriously consistent victory. Arguably the greatest coach in British sporting history, Gr\ufffdbler's unparalleled record ranks him above national heroes such as Sir Alex Ferguson and Dave Brailsford, building champions such as Sir Steve Redgrave, Sir Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell. This authoritative account of Gr\ufffdbler's career straddles the Iron Curtain, beginning in the German Democratic Republic, where systemic state-funded doping was an open secret, before crossing to Britain following the fall of the Berlin Wall. And whilst culture and sport have shifted dramatically over the last half century, Gr\ufffdbler's pursuit of greatness has never faltered. Written by Olympic medallist, Hugh Matheson, and rowing historian, Christopher Dodd, More Power is the unmissable story of one man's quest for glory, and sets out to unlock the secrets of J\ufffdrgen Gr\ufffdbler: the finest coach Olympic sport has ever seen.","details":null,"author_id":535,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":500,"name":"Hugh Matheson","top":0,"categories":[{"id":2165,"category_id":4,"product_id":1084,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":2166,"category_id":5,"product_id":1084,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":1085,"title":"How Full Is Your Bucket?

This is one of the first books to showcase both Warren Buffett's Value Investing technique and his life skills and habits for beginning investors. Sustainable results often come from changes in lifestyle and habits; hence, the first section of the book discusses habits that one needs to adopt to be able to invest like Warren Buffett, and prepares readers for a lifelong journey of wealth building. The second section examines specific stock-picking techniques. The authors look at timeless principles as well as latest ideas on where to find great investment ideas, and share specific financial indicators they look for in a good investment. The authors explain valuation principles and techniques that help investors decide when to buy a stock. The techniques are inspired by investor and economist, Benjamin Graham, the 'father of value investing', and are vastly different from the common Wall Street wisdom of trying to time the market. The final section of the book explains how the reader can build and track a portfolio of stocks. Authors encourage readers to follow Warren Buffett's first rule of investing 'Never Lose Money', and explain three important steps that significantly lower risk: - Choose good stocks with low risk - Buy at a good price with margin of safety. - Diversify into a basket of stocks. Questionnaires, charts and graphs help explain techniques and habits simply.","details":null,"author_id":538,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":325,"name":"Mary Buffett","top":0,"categories":[{"id":2175,"category_id":4,"product_id":1089,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null},{"id":2176,"category_id":5,"product_id":1089,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]},{"id":1090,"title":"The Speed of Trust","slug":"The-Speed-of-Trust","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=xZw7PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=xZw7PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780743295604","description":"From Stephen R.

Covey's proven 7 Habits to create a leadership program for kids of all ages so they can be more effective, more goal oriented, and more successful. In today's world, we are inundated with information about who to be, what to do, and how to live. But what if there was a way to learn not just what to think about, but how to think? A program that taught how to manage priorities, focus on goals, and be a positive influence? The Leader in Me is that program. In this bestseller, Stephen R. Covey took the 7 Habits that have already changed the lives of millions of readers and showed how even young children can use them as they develop. These habits-be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw-are being adapted by schools around the country in leadership programs, most famously at the A.B Combs Elementary school in Raleigh. Not only does it work, but it works better than anyone could have imaged. This book is full of examples of how the students blossom under the program: the classroom that decided to form a support group for one of their classmates who had behavioural problems; the fourth grader who found a way to overcome his fear of public speaking and wound up taking his class to see him compete in a national story telling competitive, or the seven-year-old who told her father than they needed to go outside and play because they both needed to 'sharpen the saw'. Perfect for individuals and corporations alike, The Leader in Me shows how easy it is to incorporate these skills into daily life. It is a timely answer to many of the challenges facing today's young people, businesses, parents, and educators-one that is perfectly matched to the growing demands of our certain future.","details":null,"author_id":540,"language_id":1,"age_id":null,"price":375,"name":"Stephen R.

In David Aaker's pathbreaking book, MANAGING BRAND EQUITY, managers discovered the value of a brand as a strategic asset and a company's primary source of competitive advantage. Now, in this compelling new work, Aaker uses real brand-building cases from Saturn, General Electric, Kodak, Healthy Choice, McDonald's, and others to demonstrate how strong brands have been created and managed. A common pitfall of brand strategists is to focus on brand attributes. Aaker shows how to break out of the box by considering emotional and self-expressive benefits and by introducing the brand-as-person, brand-as-organisation, and brand-as-symbol perspectives. A second pitfall is to ignore the fact that individual brands are part of a larger system consisting of many intertwined and overlapping brands and subbrands. Aaker shows how to manage the \"brand system\" to achieve clarity and synergy, to adapt to a changing environment, and to leverage brand assets into new markets and products. As executives in a wide range of industries seek to prevent their products and services from becoming commodities, they are recommitting themselves to brands as a foundation of business strategy.

epic story begins with the tale of Ashur al-Nagi, a man who grows from humble roots to become a great leader and a legend among his people. The name of Ashur epitomizes a time of glory for the harafish, or the common people, when they were led by one of their own. Generation after generation, however, Ashur's descendants stray further from his legendary example. They lose touch with their origins as they amass and then lose large fortunes, marry prostitutes when they marry at all, and develop rivalries that end in death. Finally, a Nagi appears who restores the family name to its former distinction.
